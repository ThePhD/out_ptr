# Configuring Boost.OutPtr

There are macro definitions one can employ for their project's build to change the behavior and safety of Boost.OutPtr.

* `BOOST_OUT_PTR_NO_CLEVERNESS`
** When defined, will change from using an aliasing optimization for `std::unique_ptr` and `boost::movelib` to simply using the default, stock behavior of retrieving the pointer value and then calling `.reset()` to put it back.
** This is noticeably slower (see the <<benchmarks.adoc#benchmarks, benchmarks>> for more information), but obviously safer since we are not aliasing into private members.
** This is *not* defined by default under any circumstances.
* `BOOST_OUT_PTR_CLEVER_UNIQUE_IMPLEMENTATION_FIRST_MEMBER` / `BOOST_OUT_PTR_CLEVER_MOVELIB_UNIQUE_IMPLEMENTATION_FIRST_MEMBER`
** If defined and not 0, this tells any clever optimizations for `unique`-style pointers (e.g. `std::unique_ptr` and `boost::movelib::unique_ptr`) that the pointer member comes first, rather than after any stored deleter.
** To date, no standard library has been found to have this class layout. But future ones may.
** This is *not* defined by default under any circumstances.
* `BOOST_OUT_PTR_USE_CLEVER_OUT_PTR`
** This applies specifically to `boost::out_ptr::out_ptr` and not to `boost::out_ptr::inout_ptr`.
** If defined and not 0, switches the implementation for `out_ptr` to be an unsafe clever version.
** This is *dangerous*: many C APIs do not modify the parameter on return, making it impossible to directly reseat the value inside the pointer properly!
** This is *dangerous*: aliasing memory to access private members is UB!
** This is *not* defined by default under any circumstances.
* `BOOST_OUT_PTR_USE_CLEVER_INOUT_PTR`
** This applies specifically to `boost::out_ptr::inout_ptr` and not to `boost::out_ptr::out_ptr`.
** If defined and not 0, switches the implementation for `inout_ptr` to be an unsafe clever version.
** This is *dangerous*: aliasing memory to access private members is UB!
** This is *not* defined by default under any circumstances.
* `BOOST_OUT_PTR_CLEVER_SANITY_CHECK`
** If either of the `BOOST_OUT_PTR_USE_CLEVER*` defined and not equal to zero, and this is both defined and not 0, then Boost.OutPtr will do a check on the value aliased out of the pointer to make sure it has a value equivalent to `my_smart_ptr.get()`.
** For debugging and sanity checking purposes.
** This is *not* defined by default under any circumstances.
